# Three-Way Handshake in TCP

The **Three-Way Handshake** is a critical process in the TCP/IP protocol suite that establishes a reliable connection between a client and a server. This handshake ensures that both devices are ready to communicate and agree on the initial parameters before data transfer begins.

## How It Works

The handshake involves three steps:

1. **SYN (Synchronize)**  
   The client sends a `SYN` packet to the server to initiate a connection. This packet includes an initial sequence number (ISN).
